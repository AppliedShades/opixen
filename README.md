# OPIXEN - OpenGLPixelEngine
### OpenGLPixelEngine - A minimal graphics framework built with cpp, mingw and opengl.

## Installation:
* Clone or download repository.
* Play with the example app.
* You can include opixen in your projects by copying the `include/opixen` to your project's include directory.
* You also need to install glfw, glad and glm in your preoject if following the above step.
* Or you can just make your software on top of the example app given.
* That's it, Voila!

## What's inside?
*  The Framework: `include/opixen`
*  An example app using opixen: Everything else, (built with StartCPP, a mingW c++ template from [Ifendeer/StartCPP](https://github.com/Ifendeer/StartCPP))

## Important note:
* Opixen requires GLFW, GLAD and GLM to function. If you plan on copying opixen into your previous codebase please install those libraries in your codebase. I already included them in the example app.
